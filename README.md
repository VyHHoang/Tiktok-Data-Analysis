# Tiktok-Data-Analysis

This is my capstone project for my Google Advanced Data Analytics Course. In this capstone, I used Python to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the claims classification project. I also used Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact better with the data.

This project implement the PACE problem-solving framework (Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute)
